# COVID-19 Impact on Bike Sharing System
## by Han Kim


## Dataset

> Bay Wheels (began with Bay Area Bike Share in Auguest, 2013 and with Ford GoBike in June, 2017 and named Bay Wheels from June, 2019) is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. It is operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and owned by Lyft.

> In this project, the data set of March 2020 has been chosen for understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on the bike sharing system in the Bay Area since nearly 40 million Californians including Bay Area residence were required to stay home and limit social interaction until further notice when Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a stay-at-home order on March 19 to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. According to [abc7news](https://abc7news.com/shelter-in-place-extended-bay-area-extends-stay-at-home-6-counties/6019152/), the statewide order followed similar action in the San Francisco Bay Area where residents in six counties, and later all nine, were told to shelter-in-place starting `March 17` to slow the spread of the virus.


## Summary of Findings

> The bike trips before the shelter-in-place order contributed the majority of the bike usage in March 2020 while about 18.8% were consumed by after the SIP order. On the other hand, subscribers contributed 57.3 % of the total bike trips made in March 2020 while 42.7% were consumed by customers. The right map shows how the start stations of the bike trips are distributed in the Bay Areaâ€™s map.

> Interestingly, the count of the bike users as a subscriber on each day of the week has higher than the count of the customer for both before and after the SIP order, as well as even each hour of the day. Also, in terms of the average trip distance of the bike users, there were the same patterns between subscribers and customers, which is the subscriber for bike trips has longer trips in a distance measurement than the customers. However, the average trip duration of bike trips by subscribers has fewer trips than the ones by customers. 

> On the heatmap, we can easily compare which areas of the day of the week and hour of the day get the most bike usage before and after the SIP order. During the work hours from 6 am through 9 pm on weekdays before the SIP order, there were some bike users in Bay Area, but the count of bike trips remarkably was reduced after the SIP order. Also, the count of the recreation bike trips on Sundays was reduced after the SIP order.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Let's take a look on how COVID-19 impact on a bike sharing system using Bay Wheels bike data on March 2020, especially difference of bike usages by different users types, different weekday vs weekend pattern, different hour of the day pattern, different bike rental duration, and different bike rental distance according to their own purposes of the bike sharing system on the San Francisco Bay Area.
